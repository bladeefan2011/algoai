The coursework for the course "Algoritmit ja tekoÃ¤ly"


1. To begin the usage of these algorithms, first grab one of the algorithms from the /src/ folder. (NOTE! Don't forget to take the __init__.py file as well)
2. Grab the entire testing folder for convenience's sake.
3. Grab the test_files folder.
4. Place all of the folders in the directory, eg. test--->huffman
                                                     |--->tests
                                                     |--->test_files
5. Change to the directory in terminal with: cd test
6. Run the code with python3 tests/huffman_test.py or python3 tests/lz78_test.py
